    <h1 class="">Developers Guide</h1>

    <h2 id="audience">Audience</h2>
    <p>This guide is for developers and software architects who wish to develop an integration to the BC Services Card as one of the login and authentication methods for their web-application. It is expected that you would have at least a passing knowledge of token-based authentication systems such as OAuth2, OIDC or SAML. The guide elaborates on some of the available tools provided in this and other sites which help you build and test the integration using the <strong>Open ID Connect (OIDC)</strong> framework  provided by the BC Services Card infrastructure</p>

    <h2 id="overview">Technical Overview</h2>

      <p>The following links are a good introduction or refresher to the OIDC standard.</p><h4>OIDC explanations : </h4><p><a href="https://medium.com/@robert.broeckelmann/saml2-vs-jwt-understanding-openid-connect-part-1-fffe0d50f953">https://medium.com/@robert.broeckelmann/saml2-vs-jwt-understanding-openid-connect-part-1-fffe0d50f953</a></p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@robert.broeckelmann/saml2-vs-jwt-understanding-openid-connect-part-2-f361ca867baa">https://medium.com/@robert.broeckelmann/saml2-vs-jwt-understanding-openid-connect-part-2-f361ca867baa</a></p><h4>OIDC spec</h4><p><a href="https://openid.net/developers/specs/">https://openid.net/developers/specs/</a></p><h4>BC Services Card specific OIDC documentation</h4><p>Open ID Connect<a href="https://github.com/bcgov/servicescard-selfservice/blob/master/documents/BC_Services_Card_OIDC_Integration_Guide1.0.3%20(6).pdf"><span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="f2a02edc-6455-488a-a84e-ab5b1efee3cb"></span> Integration guide</a></p>
      <h4>Glossary</h4>
      <p>We will make use of the following terms in the self-service application, so it is a good idea to brush up on your knowledge of them : </p><ul><li><p>JWKS - JSON web key store. used to store public keys used to verify and encrypt JSON Web Tokens</p></li><li><p>JWT - JSON Web Token</p></li><li><p>Scopes - Sets of data attributes returned with the JWT</p></li><li><p>Userinfo - A particular endpoint returning the user profile scope</p></li><li><p>Client ID - Unique identifier to your application</p></li><li><p>Client Secret - Password string which, together with the Client ID allows access to the IODC token endpoint</p></li><li><p>“Well-known” discovery endpoint - The freely accessible endpoint describing all salient features of the OIDC provider</p></li><li><p>Relying Party - the party relying on the OIDC provider - basically you</p></li><li><p>Digital signing and encryption algorithms - algorithms used for signing and encrypting the JWT returns</p></li></ul>

      Also, for brevity we will refer to the BC Services Card Infrastructure or "back-end" as  "BCSCI", and the BC Services Card Self-Service application as "BSCS-SS"

      <h4>Basic operation</h4>
      
      <p>For all architectures the the user is redirected to, and authenticated by, the BCSCI independently from your calling application.</p><p>On successful authentication, a series of token exchanges take place resulting in an access-token which can be used to get user identity information (also known as &quot;scopes&quot;) such as email address, first and last names or mailing address. Other than the data contained in the scopes which you select, there is no data accessible from the BCSCI. It is generally accepted good-practice to limit the scopes requested to the minimum needed for your purposes, because the BC Services Card does return personally identifiable information which requires a high degree of regulatory compliance - the less data you get, the less the chance of leakage.</p><p> The BCSC-SS application enables you to register with the system and return you the necessary client ID, secret and test accounts for you to plug into your application</p><p />
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h2 id="idsecret">Get a Client ID and Secret</h2>

    </p>         <p>The four things you need for accessing the BC Services Card infrastructure are : </p><ul><li><p>Client ID</p></li><li><p>Client Secret</p></li><li><p>Scopes</p></li><li><p>Test accounts</p></li></ul>
    <h4>Development/Test</h4>
    <p>For access to the Test BCSCI, you will create a new development project in the BCSC-SS application.     It is a simple matter of running through the “Create new project” wizard.This registers your organisation and delivers the necessary items in a couple of minutes. You will need to know the following details about your own application and infrastructure to be able to complete the wizard. (<strong>Hint</strong> - you can modify your details any time, so start off simply eg. default signing, no encryption, and then ramp up complexity as needed. Perhaps even begin with one of the sample applications in the following section ?)</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Signing algorithm</strong> - what algorithm do you require for signing the access-token and userinfo return JWT ? The BCSC-SS only supports asymmetric encryption,the options are :</li>
        <ul>
          <li>RS256 (default)</li>
          <li>RS384</li>
          <li>RS512</li>
          <li>ES256</li>
          <li>ES384</li>
          <li>ES512</li>
          <li>PS256</li>
          <li>PS384</li>
          <li>PS512</li>
        </ul>
<p/>
        If unsure, use the default RS256. Note that you will need the public key from the opposing JWKS, the URL for this can be obtained from the BCSCI .well-known discovery endpoint under "jwks_uri"

        <li><strong>Application URL</strong> - your home page URL</li>
        <li><strong> Redirect URI</strong> - up to 10 can be entered. Note that the BCSCI will not allow a redirect to a URI other than in this list for your application. </li>
        <li><strong>Scopes</strong> - the user attributes or scopes you require. We describe these in the BCSC-SS as "packages" - choose that which corresponds most closely to the data you need</li>
        <li><strong>Test accounts</strong> - the number of test accounts you will need, mostly one or 2 for initial testing. Test accounts are only relevant to the BCSCI Test environment and comprise an ID and a password instead of the usual BC Service card authentication mechanism which typically requires a mobile device for the second authentication factor. They are essential for testing your application without using real data. </li>
        <li><strong>Encryption and encoding algorithms</strong>. The returned data can optionally be encrypted. The BCSC-SS app only allows the selection of asymmetric encryption algorithms since the use of symmetric algorithms is generally considered insecure, and requires that both userinfo and id_token encryptions are the same.The available options for encryption algorithms are</li>
        <ul>
          <li>RSA1_5(default)</li>
          <li>RSA-OAEP</li>
        </ul>  
        <p>and the encoding can be</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A256GCM (default)</li>
          <li>A256CBC+HS512</li>
          <li>A192GCM</li>
          <li>A128GCM</li>
          <li>A128CBC-HS256</li>
          <li>A256CBC-HS512</li>
          <li>A128CBC+HS256</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <p></p>If using encryption you will need a JWKS set up , and the URL to your JWKS entered into the wizard. (there is sample code on setting up a JWKS in the  github repo if required) </li>
      </ul>
      <p/>
      <p>Once you have your client ID, client secret and test accounts, you are ready to plug these, together with the JWKS, access-token and userinfo endpoints into your application. These endpoints are described in the ".well-known" discovery endpoint of <a href="https://idtest.gov.bc.ca/login/.well-known/openid-configuration">https://idtest.gov.bc.ca/login/.well-known/openid-configuration</a></p>
  

    <h4>Production</h4>
    
    <p> For migrating your application and your BCSC-SS project into your production system, and by implication integrating with the BC Services Card Production environment, the process involves more paperwork and rigour, and sign-off by managers, since the BC Services Card delivers personally identifiable data. From a software development perspective there are a number of differences between the integration with the BC Services Card test environment and the BC Services Card production environment which need to be factored in, the major one being that in production you MUST encrypt all traffic to your application, so you will need to provide a JWKS and encryption and encoding algorithms.<p>The table below summarises the differences between production and development : </p>
    
    <table aria-describedby="Comparison between dev and prod" >

    <h2 id="testandtrouble">Testing and Troubleshooting </h2>
    <h2>Testing</h2><p>In order to test out your integration with BC Services Card you will need test accounts. Unlike real BC Services Card accounts (tied to real people) these do NOT need 2-factor authentication through a second device (typically mobile phone) , they are simply an ID and passcode , which allow easy testing of your integration. They are, however, only able to be used to test in your Dev environment. Once you migrate to the Production environment and are pointed at the Production BC Services Card servers, you will need to use real users for testing.</p><p>Test accounts are granted as part of the BCSC-SS application</p><h2>Troubleshooting</h2><p /><p /><p /><p />
