<h1>Is this for me ?</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>        
     <p><strong>Why you would use this application</strong></p>
     <p>The BC Services Card Self Service application enables you as team member of a BPS agency to have an easy -access point into deploying the BC Services Card as an authentication credential for the your BPS' web application.

     </p>
     <p>
      We use a two-stepped approach where BPS teams can prototype an integration in our test environment, using fictitious BC Services Card data as a test and, when they are ready for production (go live), prepare and submit their materials to integrate the production BC Services Card system. Please use the Self Assessment below to see if this is a fit for your organization.
     </p>
