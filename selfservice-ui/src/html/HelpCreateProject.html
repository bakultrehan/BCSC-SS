        <h1>Prototype</h1>
        <h2>Start a Project to experiment through a proof of concept</h2>
        <p>We call the activities in this step a <strong>development access request</strong>.It is designed to be free from barriers, enabling developers to easily access data within a protected development tier. It allows for a quick implementation of a proof of concept or a working model of the BC Services Card within a BPS application.</p>
        <p>Key things to keep in mind in this step:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Identity Information: </strong>The BC Services Card provides a higher level of identity assurance and following authentication, identity information about a person is available. We’ve created a set of pre-defined identity data attributes, or scope packages as we call them, for BPS developers to experiment with.  These packages are designed to make it easy to understand how you can integrate with BC Services Card.
          </li>
      
          <li><strong>Test Accounts:</strong> Test BC Services Card accounts are provided to let developers test their work using test data. </li>
            
          <li><strong>Client ID and Secret:</strong> After submitting a development access request, a developer obtains a data sharing client id  and secret as per our protocols of Open ID Connect (OIDC) Application Programming Interface (API).
          </li>
        </ul>


        <h1>Development Access Request Flow</h1>
        <p>Requesting a development Client ID and secret through the BC Services Card Self-Service application is designed to be free from barriers, enabling developers to easily access data within a protected development tier. This allows for a quick implementation of a proof of concept or a working model of the BC Services Card within a Broader Public Sector (BPS) application.</p>

        <p> </p><h2>Draft Status</h2>
        <p>The request is placed in Draft Status as the Broader Public Sector (BPS) project team provides details on their project and selects the Open ID Connect (OIDC) scope/data attributes package.</p>
        <p>After you’ve logged in to the Self-Service application, the request is placed in Draft Status.  When in Draft Status, the Broader Public Sector (BPS) team gathers and provides details on their project and selects the Open ID Connect (OIDC) scope/package.</p>

        <p> </p><h2>Moving from Draft to Development Status</h2>
        <p>In order to obtain the Open ID Connect (OIDC) Client ID and Client Secret, the Broader Public Sector (BPS) team member submits the request moving it from <em>Draft</em> to <em>Development s</em>tatus.</p>
        <p>The Development Status lets the BPS team experiment through an integration in a BC Services Card test environment with fictitious BC Services Card data.</p>

        <h2>Details for Development Access Request Flow </h2><p>The following sections map your Self Service Project with the technical details needed for your integration with BC Services Card.  We suggest the individuals you consider to be your <strong>Manager and Developer </strong>sit together to review this section. </p>
