    <h2 id="manager">About the BC Services Card</h2>

    <p>
      The BC Services Card is a government issued ID that can be used to log in
      to participating services online when it is paired with your mobile
      device. The BC Services Card provides a high identity assurance level
      which gives your public agency clients the confidence that the person
      trying to access their online service is who they say they are.

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>
      The application uses a two-stepped approach where the BPS teams can
      experiment with an integration in our test environment, using fictious BC
      Services Card data as a test and then, when they are ready, prepare and
      submit their materials to create a live integration with real citizen BC
      Services Cards.
