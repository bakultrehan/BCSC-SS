    <h3>About the BC Services Card</h3>

    <p>
      The BC Services Card is a government issued ID that can be used to log in
      to participating services online when it is paired with your mobile
      device. The BC Services Card provides a high identity assurance level
      which gives your public agency clients the confidence that the person
      trying to access their online service is who they say they are.

    <h3>Who is this for?</h3>

    <p>
      This BC Services Card self-service implementation is available for
      organizations that fall within the BC Broader Public Sector (BPS). The BC
      Services Card Self-Service application enables organizations within the
      BPS to have an easy-access point into deploying the BC Services Card as an
      authentication mechanism for the BPS organization&#146;s own web
      application. We want to help BPS agencies integrate with the BC Services
      Card.
    </p>

    <p>
      Self-service uses a two-stepped approach where the BPS teams can
      experiment with an integration in our test environment, using fictious BC
      Services Card data as a test and then, when they are ready, prepare and
      submit their materials to create a live integration with real citizen BC
      Services Cards.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 1: Experiment through a proof of concept</h3>

    <p>
      We call the activities in this step a <em>development access request</em>.
      This process is designed to be free from barriers, enabling developers to
      easily access data within a protected development tier. It allows
      developers to create a quick implementation of a proof of concept or
      working model of BC Services Card login functionality integrated with
      their own BPS application. The key things to keep in mind in this step:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Identity Information:</strong>The BC Services Card provides a
        higher level of identity assurance and during an authentication
        transaction, identity information about a person is available.
        We&#146;ve created a set of pre-defined identity data attributes or
        scope packages as we call them, for BPS developers to experiment with.
        We believe offering these packages provides a simple experience in
        understanding how to integrate with BC Services Card.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Test Accounts:</strong>Test BC Services Card accounts are
        provided to let developers test their work using mock data in a
        development environment.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>API Key and Secret:</strong>After submitting a development
        access request, a developer will obtain a data sharing key and secret as
        per our protocols of Open ID Connect (OIDC) API.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <img src="help-img/5stepstodev.png" alt="5 steps to dev" />

    <p>
      Once the proof of concept has been tested and is completed to the BPSâ€™
      satisfaction, the BPS team should inform the Provincial Identity
      Information Management (IDIM) Program through the self-service application
      to begin the process of a <em>Live Access Request</em>. We want to keep
      things simple and are asking for the contact information of 3 types of
      team members from the BPS with respect to a Live Access Request:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A developer, who uses the API key and secret details to configure the
        OpenID Connect configuration for the BPS online service.
      </li>
      <li>
        A manager, who will be involved in the end to end Live Access Request
        Process. This person works with both the development and executive team.
      </li>
      <li>
        An executive sponsor, who has the accountability and authority to sign
        off on privacy documents, security documents and service agreements.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each defined member of the project team will be required to log in to the
      BC Services Card self-service application to view the project(s) they have
      access to and to advance the project through the steps to production, in
      accordance with their project role.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 2: Begin the Live BC Services Card request process</h3>

    <p>
      The <em>Live Access Request</em> process is designed to enable BPS teams
      to work at their own pace to understand and address the various categories
      of compliance before integrating with a live production-ready environment
      of BC Services Card data. A member of the Provincial Identity Information
      Management Program is always available to help BPS clients in completing
      the integration components. The BC Services Card self-service application
      will guide you through these steps.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Provincial Identity Information Management Program is mandated to
      provide identity and authentication services using the BC Services Card to
      support citizen transactions with government services. BPS integration
      with the BC Services Card requires agreement and adherance to categorized
      compliance items to ensure privacy, security and other needs are met to
      the satisfaction of the Provincial Identity Information Management
      Program. This self-service system will guide you through these compliance
      areas.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once a user has completed all of the items in each of the compliance
      categories, a member of the Provincial Identity Information Management
      (IDIM) Program will provide the BPS team with a new data sharing key and
      secret for using the OpenIDConnect (OIDC) API to provide authentication
      for the live production environment.
    </p>

    <h3>How to begin</h3>

    <p>
      The BC Services Card Self-Service application has been created to provide
      developers from Broader Public Sector (BPS) organizations with
      straightforward access to the tools that will enable them to easily build
      a proof of concept or working model in a development environment to
      connect their organization's applications with the BC Services Card login
      functionality.
    </p>

    <p>
      Begin by logging into the BC Services Card Self-Service application with
      your own BC Services Card, your existing IDIR login (if you have one) or
      your GitHub account.
    </p>

    <p>
      Create a project to get started. The project will be created in the
      Development Access Request state and will allow you to set up the
      configuration for your application in order to receive an API key and
      secret for use in your development environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moving into a <em>Live Access Request</em> towards gaining access to a
      production environment will require you to enter some information about
      your project team (Manager, Executive Sponsor) who will be required to
      work through some categorized compliance steps. The BC Services Card
      Self-Service application will guide your team through this process.
    </p>

    <h3>GitHub Repository</h3>

    <p>
      The following GitHub repository is provided to assist you with your
      development and integration. You will find technical documentation, sample
      code and applications in the repository to assist you in your
      experimentation, proofs of concept and implementation.

    <h3>Technical Architecture Overview</h3>
    <p>
      There are a number of different ways in which a web application might use
      the BC Services Card as a login option, we discuss two common
      architectures.
    </p>

    <p>
      For all architectures the BC Services Card uses Open ID Connect (OIDC) as
      the authentication mechanism whereby the user is presented a login screen
      from the BC Services Card (or IAS) infrastructure and the authentication
      and validation therein are completely separate to the calling application.
    </p>

    <p>
      On successful login, a token is passed to the calling application, which
      can be used to get user attribute data (also known as &quot;scopes&quot;)
      such as email address, first and last names or mailing address in
      subsequent calls to IAS. In this application, the scopes are pre-defined
      in packages. You will select a package that meets the needs of your
      organization. The OIDC flow used is the &quot;Authorization Code
      Flow&quot;.
